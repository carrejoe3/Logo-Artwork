Here's what you need to know:

When you make a purchase with ZippyPixels, your item is yours to use in personal and commercial projects. It is royalty free, which basically means that once you've paid us for it, you don't have to pay us again for the same item. There's no need to attribute or link back to ZippyPixels (unless you're really awesome and you want to spread the word).

Here's what you can do:

You are free to modify the resource as you like, but we are not legally liable for your misuse of our products.

You are also free to purchase as many files as you'd like and use each file an indefinite amount of times.

Here's what you can't do:

You can't resell, redistributive, give away, license, sub-license, or lease any of our resources to a third party—even if you purchased it. This license gives you exclusive rights, but those rights are non-transferrable to a third party. This means, you cannot upload our resources for distribution on your website, any media sharing tool, or any marketplace. You also may not include our resources as a separate attachment for your work.

If you purchase a PSD website template from ZippyPixels, you can create a website theme or template but you cannot sell (or give away) that theme or template. It can only be used for your own personal and commercial projects.

You cannot hotlink to the direct link to a resource's download. You also cannot hotlink to images that are hosted by ZippyPixels. That's just not cool.

Please contact us if you need further clarification on the license agreement. We'll be happy to help.
